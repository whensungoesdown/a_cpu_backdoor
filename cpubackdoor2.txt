--[ 1. Introduction

The whole CPU backdoor thing is pretty wild. People are always speculating
if they're real or not. It's hard to believe big tech giants like IBM,
Intel, and AMD never even thought about putting them in. Backdoors,
especially CPU ones, should be like super stealthy Kungfu moves, saved for
breaking into the most fortified systems as a last resort. It reminds me of
that scene in "Swordfish" where Standly's trying to hack into the DoD's
system. He's already planted a trojan horse, so eventually he gets in. (But
seriously, if he already had a backdoor, why all the drama?) 

When discussing CPU backdoors, hidden instructions often immediately come
to mind. However, to activate them, attackers typically require the
capability to execute code within the system. But how do they gain access
to the system in the first place?  Now, consider if the CPU had a hardware
backdoor itself. Any system utilizing such a CPU could potentially enable
the attacker to log in, regardless of any prior interaction with the
system.

Components such as BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) and Intel AMT
(Active Management Technology), along with their chip controlling buses,
undoubtedly have the capability to impose full control over the system at
the deepest level. However, these features are generally documented to some
extent and are often considered part of the broader umbrella term RAS
(Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability). Customers should already
be fully aware of the risks when their devices are advertised as
conveniently manageable.

Our objective is to embed a CPU backdoor within instruction implementations
at the microarchitecture level.  We are not try to make a
halt-and-catch-fire instruction. Rather, we aim for the CPU backdoor to
assist us at crucial moments, such as logging into the system. However,
during the execution of instructions by the CPU core, the high-level OS
context is lost. Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that the operating system
authentication module has seen little change over the years.  This may be a
deliberate arrangement or simply due to the maturity of the code.

Years ago, a hacking technique surfaced involving an ATM equipped with a
Windows XP system. A hacker discovered that the ATM had an exposed firewire
port. To bypass the Windows XP password authentication, the hacker utilized
the firewire port to access the computer's memory and modify the code
responsible for verifying input passwords. This alteration enabled the
hacker to log into the ATM using any password. The specific code that
needed patching was within the Windows logon process, which pads the input
password and generates a 16-byte hash using the NTLM proprietary hashing
algorithm. The msv1_0.dll module in Windows XP contains the
MsvpPasswordValidate() function, which compares the generated hash with the
one stored in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database. By patching
this function to always return true, even with an incorrect password, the
hacker could achieve unauthorized access. Additionally, a predefined
password hash could be encoded within the function, allowing a secret
password to log in to any user account in the system.

Even more intriguingly, the hash used is unsalted. Surprisingly, even
Windows 10 continues to employ unsalted hashes (I haven't had a chance to
test Windows 11 yet, so let's hope nothing has changed). Introducing a CPU
password backdoor would be particularly convenient due to the
predictability of an unsalted hash. Within the CPU's ALU (Arithmetic Logic
Unit) module, malicious circuitry lies in wait for a predetermined hash
value. When this hash is compared with the correct one stored in the
system, the ALU alters the result of the CMP instruction to falsely
indicate that the hash is correct. This deception allows the user to log in
with the predefined secret password.

To demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this backdoor on a
commercial CPU, I opted to develop it on OpenSPARC T1, which is the
open-source variant of the Sun Microsystems UltraSPARC T1. OpenSPARC offers
a Xilinx EDK (Embedded Development Kit) project, enabling the T1 system to
run on a Xilinx ML505-V5LX110T FPGA board. This setup allowed me to test
the backdoor on an actual CPU to the extent possible. However, Windows
cannot operate on a SPARC machine. Therefore, I pursued two separate
projects. Firstly, I utilized QEMU with TCG (Tiny Code Generator) to
showcase the backdoor on a virtual X86 machine running the Windows system.
Additionally, I implemented the backdoor in Verilog code on the OpenSPARC
T1 and tested it with a Linux system.

In Linux and other *nix systems, the adoption of salted hashes complicates
the implementation of the backdoor. Nonetheless, it remains feasible. Due
to the salt, the CPU cannot identify predefined hash values. However, the
username can still be transmitted as clear text to the CPU before
authentication. The operating system also plays a crucial role,
particularly by maintaining critical code unchanged for decades.

The paper is structured into three main sections. Firstly, we investigate
background information on existing CPU "backdoors." Then, we demonstrate
our new CPU backdoor. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future
research.


--[ 2. Known CPU "Backdoors"

When considering CPU "backdoors," hidden instructions often come to mind.
For instance, an attacker might gain the highest privilege by executing a
specific instruction. Undoubtedly, there are undocumented instructions
[5][6][7][8]. By examining the opcode space outlined in the manual, it
becomes evident that numerous opcodes are either undocumented or unused.
Nonetheless, all instructions must adhere to the opcode encoding rule,
making it feasible to enumerate all potential instructions. Nevertheless,
there could still be undisclosed extension bytes for architectures with
variable-length instructions, such as x86.

Below is a segment of Intel's 2-byte opcode map. These instructions begin
with the escape code 0F. Let's examine a few examples to understand how it
functions. For instance, the INVD instruction corresponds to 0F08, while
WBINVD is represented by 0F09. The second byte is determined by the row and
column index. For instance, vmovapd should be 660F28, as indicated by the
map, which specifies a prefix of 66.

The map also contains numerous blanks, like 0F0A, which could denote either
an undocumented or invalid instruction. Another example is 0F3F at the
bottom right, which we'll discuss later, also leaving a blank. In this
instance, it represents a partially documented instruction from the VIA's
x86 CPU, known as ALTINST (alternate instruction). Although VIA's manual
acknowledges the existence of this alternative instruction, it lacks
comprehensive details on its usage (the alternate instruction set remains
undisclosed). Customers must contact the vendor for additional information.

The map also indicates "3-byte escape" in the seventh row, indicating
instructions with a 3-byte opcode that begins with the escape code 0F38 or
0F3A. We can then refer to the corresponding 3-byte opcode map to discover
more instructions in this category. Although the Intel manual suggests that
the 3-byte opcode is already the longest, theoretically, subsequent bytes
could also be escape codes. Additionally, the blank between 0F38 and 0F3A
may prompt questions about what 0F39 represents. Is it an undocumented
instruction or an undocumented escape code? The presence of other blanks
raises similar questions. Therefore, I propose that this is where we should
focus our investigation, identifying all the escape codes, rather than
attempting to enumerate the entire encoding space from scratch.

There's another type of hidden instruction, or rather, a hidden function.
Although the instruction itself is documented, it might require a specific
value set in a register to activate it [15][16][3]. For example, CPUID
retrieves various CPU information with different register values. While
this seems standard, consider the potential if the CPU could do more with
the correct code. Certain debugging functions of AMD CPUs operate in this
manner. This approach not only allows for including obscure functions but
also avoids interfering with the system's regular operations, making
detection less likely. This method could be particularly advantageous,
especially on 64-bit systems, as it's unlikely for a user to accidentally
input the correct secret 64-bit code.


----[ 2.1 VIA C3 ALTINST Instructions

The VIA C3 processor includes an instruction called ALTINST[9], encoded as
0F 3F. This instruction is detailed in the C3 manual and acts as the
gateway to an alternate instruction set. However, this alternate set is not
documented and is believed to consist of RISC-like microcodes that operate
internally within the CPU. The C3 manual says: "This alternate instruction
set is intended for testing, debug, and special application usage.
Accordingly, it is not documented for general usage. If you have a
justified need for access to these instructions, contact your VIA
representative." 

This alternate instruction set includes an expanded array of integer, MMX,
floating-point, and 3DNow! instructions, along with additional registers.
Within this alternate instruction set, privileged functions can be accessed
from any protection level, memory descriptor checks can be bypassed, and
various x86 exceptions like alignment checks can be avoided. 

To utilize these instructions, the ALTINST bit must be set to 1 in the
FEATURE CONTROL REGISTER (FCR) MSR using the WRMSR instruction. If ALTINST
is set to 0, executing 0F3F will result in an Invalid Instruction
exception. Once the ALTINST bit is set, the 0F3F instruction can be
executed from any privilege level, causing a near branch to CS:EAX.
Additionally, besides the branch, the 0F3F instruction places the processor
into an internal mode where the target bytes are interpreted not as x86
instructions but as instructions from the alternate instruction set.

The alternate instructions fetched following the 0x0F3F branch should be in
the form of 0x8D8400XXXXXXXX, where XXXXXXXX represents the 32-bit
alternate instruction. This is presented as the 32-bit displacement of an
LEA [EAX+EAX+disp]. Upon fetching, the LEA "wrapper" is removed, and the
32-bit alternate instruction is executed. This arrangment is clever because
if the disassembler interprets 0F3F as a NOP, then all subsequent x86
instructions seem genuine.

This topic has been discussed [10]. Moreover, patents related to VIA
processor microarchitecture [11][12][13][14] suggest that the alternate
instruction set likely consists of internal microinstructions. However, an
in-depth investigation into this alternate instruction set is not the focus
of this paper.


----[ 2.2 AMD Secret Password 0x9C5A203A

Model Specific Registers (MSRs) are various control registers in the x86
instruction set used for tasks like debugging, program execution tracing,
computer performance monitoring, and toggling certain CPU features.
Accessing these registers involves using the RDMSR and WRMSR instructions,
which read from and write to the registers, respectively, using a 32-bit
integer as the MSR index. Some MSRs are undocumented, and what's even more
intriguing is that certain undocumented MSRs require a password for access.
For instance, the password 0x9C5A203A enables the hidden debugging function
of AMD K8 processors. According to internet user Czernobyl, these
undocumented MSRs are primarily used for debugging purposes. To enable the
debugging capability, one needs to input the password 0x9C5A203A into the
EDI register. Otherwise, a General Protection Fault (GPF) exception occurs.

In an AMD white paper titled "Live Migration with AMD-V Extended Migration
Technology,"[4] password-protected MSRs are mentioned. The following code
sample illustrates how a hypervisor or operating system can suppress the
reporting of the RDTSCP instruction on the Second-Generation AMD Opteron
processor.


/*
 * Example 3: Use MSR C001_1005 to clear bit 27 (RDTSCP) reported in
 * EDX after CPUID Function 8000_0001
 */

        /*
         Read current value of the CPUID Override MSR C001_1005.
         After RDMSR completes, EDX:EAX contains the 64bit MSR value.
         EDX is loaded with the high 32 bits of the MSR and EAX is loaded
         with the low 32 bits. The low 32 bits of this MSR are returned in
         EDX after CPUID Function 8000_0001
        */

        /*
         Write the new EDX:EAX value into CPUID override MSR.
         Second-Generation AMD Opteron Processors require a
         32 bit password in EDI. Contact AMD to get the password.
        */

                MOV EDI, <PASSWORD>
        
                MOV CX, 0xC0011005h
                RDMSR

        /*
         Clear bit 27 (RDTSCP) of EAX register
        */

                ANDL EAX, 0xF7FFFFFFh
                WRMSR



According to AMD's white paper, the password is only necessary for writing
a specific bit in MSR c0011005h. Discovering such a hidden feature is quite
challenging.


----[ 2.3 Backdoor Instruction Candidates

Fully documented and benign, this instruction sparks a clever idea worth
mentioning. It is the OR instruction in the IBM Power ISA[19].

"or RA,RS,RB: The contents of register RS are ORed with the contents of
register RB and the result is placed into register RA. Some forms of or
Rx,Rx,Rx provide special functions; see Section 3.2 and Section 4.3.3, both
in Book II."

It is a typical OR instruction using registers. But when all three operands
are the same register, essentially doing nothing, it triggers special
functions like adjusting process priority levels and providing cache hints.
For instance, "or 2, 2, 2" (using general register 2) sets the process
priority to "medium," innocuous on the surface. Yet, consider the
possibility of exploiting it to adjust current privileges—it could become a
handy backdoor.


--[ 3. A New CPU Backdoor

The known backdoors mentioned earlier, and proposed ideas[3][18] imply that
the attacker must already have the ability to execute instructions within
the system. However, gaining initial access to the system can sometimes be
the primary challenge. Let's concentrate on the login process. Password
authentication remains a fundamental method for system authentication. The
user submits their username and password, and the system evaluates it. If
the CPU is compromised, the attacker may find a means to communicate with
it, essentially saying, "It is me, let me in."


----[ 3.1 Backdoored Instruction to Bypass OS Authentication

First, let's grasp how password authentication operates. In the Windows
system, during login, the user's password undergoes padding, and a 16-byte
hash is generated using the NTLM proprietary algorithm. Then, the
MsvpPasswordValidate() function from msv1_0.dll compares this hash with the
one stored in the SAM database using RtlCompareMemory(). If they match,
authentication succeeds.

Below is the code for RtlCompareMemory().

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory:
76ff6970 56 push esi
76ff6971 57 push edi
76ff6972 fc cld
76ff6973 8b74240c mov esi,dword ptr [esp+0Ch]
76ff6977 8b7c2410 mov edi,dword ptr [esp+10h]
76ff697b 8b4c2414 mov ecx,dword ptr [esp+14h]
76ff697f c1e902 shr ecx,2
76ff6982 7404 je ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x18 (76ff6988)

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x14:
76ff6984 f3a7 repe cmps dword ptr [esi],dword ptr es:[edi]
76ff6986 7516 jne ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x2e (76ff699e)

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x18:
76ff6988 8b4c2414 mov ecx,dword ptr [esp+14h]
76ff698c 83e103 and ecx,3
76ff698f 7404 je ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x25 (76ff6995)

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x21:
76ff6991 f3a6 repe cmps byte ptr [esi],byte ptr es:[edi]
76ff6993 7516 jne ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x3b (76ff69ab)

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x25:
76ff6995 8b442414 mov eax,dword ptr [esp+14h]
76ff6999 5f pop edi
76ff699a 5e pop esi
76ff699b c20c00 ret 0Ch

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x2e:
76ff699e 83ee04 sub esi,4
76ff69a1 83ef04 sub edi,4
76ff69a4 b904000000 mov ecx,4
76ff69a9 f3a6 repe cmps byte ptr [esi],byte ptr es:[edi]

ntdll!RtlCompareMemory+0x3b:
76ff69ab 4e dec esi
76ff69ac 2b74240c sub esi,dword ptr [esp+0Ch]
76ff69b0 8bc6 mov eax,esi
76ff69b2 5f pop edi
76ff69b3 5e 


The hash data consists of 16 bytes, and memory is allocated in a
word-aligned manner. This results in four 32-bit comparisons on x86 systems
and two 64-bit comparisons on x86_64 systems using the CMPS instruction. If
the hash data is compared byte by byte, the hash data could be obscured
among the numerous regular CMPS instructions.  The core of the function is
the following instruction if the data's memory is word-aligned.


x86
"f3a7   repe cmps dword ptr [esi],dword ptr es:[edi]"

x86_64 
"f348a7  repe cmps qword ptr [rsi],qword ptr [rdi]"


The esi and edi registers hold the memory addresses of the two hashes,
while ecx stores the count of comparisons to be made. "repe" or "repz"
represents the repeat prefix, causing the CMPS instruction to iterate until
ecx reaches zero or the previous result becomes unequal. CMPS can be seen
as the crucial instruction in the Windows password authentication system
since its outcome decides the success or failure of authentication.
However, it lacks software-level context, only the data itself can be
recognized.

Let's take "123" as the secret password, with its hash being
0x97e6bd3da79016d7eb4b206978362812. During the CMPS instruction on x86 systems,
the edi register holds the memory pointer, sequentially reading the data
0x97e6bd3d, 0xa79016d7, 0xeb4b2069, and 0x78362812. On x86_64 systems, the data
in the 64-bit thunk consists of 0xa79016d797e6bd3d and 0x78362812eb4b2069. When
the backdoored CPU encounters these values during CMPS, it sets the Z flag,
indicating equality regardless of the actual memory content. This results in
"123" successfully authenticating against any password in the system.

The CMPS instruction is rather complicated. It performs two memory loads
followed by a comparison. In actual x86 CPUs, it is decoded into microcode,
with a single microinstruction dedicated to the comparison process.


----[ 3.2 Prototype on x86 QEMU TCG

I really wish I could put this backdoor on a real x86 CPU. But right now, I
can't find an open-source x86 CPU good enough for running the Windows
system, and I can't build one myself. So, for now, I'll demonstrate the
backdoor design using the QEMU TCG emulator.

TCG (Tiny Code Generator) serves as the dynamic binary translation engine
for QEMU. It converts target instructions through TCG frontend-ops, which
are then compiled into host instructions. This process is known as Dynamic
Binary Translation. While it's still software emulation, it's considerably
faster than interpreters like Bochs, as it compiles instructions rather
than interpreting each one individually.

The function below is responsible for decoding the target binary, making it
a good starting point to understand TCG.


static target_ulong disas_insn (DisasContext *s, CPUState *cpu);


You can find it in "target/i386/tcg/translate.c," and both x86 and x86_64
architectures use the same file. disas_insn() features a large switch-case
statement that decodes each instruction. In this context, 0xa7 represents
the opcode for CMPS with dword operands, as depicted in the code snippet.


    case 0xa6: /* cmpsS */
    case 0xa7:
        ot = mo_b_d(b, dflag);
        if (prefixes & PREFIX_REPNZ) {
            gen_repz_cmps(s, ot, pc_start - s->cs_base,
                          s->pc - s->cs_base, 1);
        } else if (prefixes & PREFIX_REPZ) {
            gen_repz_cmps(s, ot, pc_start - s->cs_base, 
                          s->pc - s->cs_base, 0);
        } else {
            gen_cmps(s, ot);
        }
        break;


The gen_cmps() function manages individual CMPS instructions, while
gen_repz_cmps() is a micro that handles prefixed CMPS instructions,
eventually calling gen_cmps() for each iteration.


static inline void gen_cmps(DisasContext *s, MemOp ot)
{
    gen_string_movl_A0_EDI(s);
    gen_op_ld_v(s, ot, s->T1, s->A0);
    gen_string_movl_A0_ESI(s);
    gen_op(s, OP_CMPL, ot, OR_TMP0);
    gen_op_movl_T0_Dshift(s, ot);
    gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_ESI);
    gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_EDI);
}


The gen_cmps() function comprises TCG front-end ops[1], which are C
functions prefixed with tcg_, like tcg_gen_mov_tl(). Additionally, TCG
offers a helper function mechanism to facilitate the emulation of more
intricate operations.


static inline void gen_cmps(DisasContext *s, MemOp ot)
{
    TCGv ret0;
    ret0 = tcg_temp_local_new();

    gen_string_movl_A0_EDI(s);
    gen_op_ld_v(s, ot, s->T1, s->A0);
    gen_string_movl_A0_ESI(s);

    gen_helper_malicious_cmps(ret0, cpu_env, s->T1);
    gen_malicious_op(s, OP_CMPL, ot, OR_TMP0, ret0);

    gen_op_movl_T0_Dshift(s, ot);
    gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_ESI);
    gen_op_add_reg_T0(s, s->aflag, R_EDI);

    tcg_temp_free(ret0);
}


We've added a helper function called gen_helper_malicious_cmps() to
implement extra malicious handling on the CMPS instruction. It checks if
edi/rdi matches the secret password hash. If it does, gen_malicious_op()
alters the instruction's result. Although TCG ops could perform this check
faster, the helper function enables the use of printf and other libraries,
greatly facilitating debugging. Below is the helper code for both x86 and
x86_64 architectures, along with part of the gen_malicious_op() code.

The secret password "123" will authenticate successfully once the CMPS
instruction encounters all the hash fragments. Therefore, on this QEMU
virtual machine, regardless of the installed Windows system, you can
utilize "123" as the secret password to access any user account without
requiring any modifications to the Windows system.


--[ 3.3 Prototype on Sparc64 (OpenSPARC T1) FPGA

To demonstrate the feasibility of the backdoor on real CPUs, we developed a
prototype on OpenSPARC T1. OpenSPARC T1 is the open-source counterpart of
Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC T1, known as code name Niagara. Featuring
multithreading and multicore capabilities, the core has a single-issue,
in-order, 6-stage pipeline design. The source code is accessible under the
GNU General Public License v2. Xilinx's OpenSPARC Evaluation Platform
(ML505-V5LX110T) is an FPGA board specifically designed to accommodate a
complete OpenSPARC T1 system, encompassing the CPU, DDR memory controller,
Ethernet, and more. Utilizing the source code, and the FPGA board, this
setup represents the closest approximation to testing on a commercial CPU.

The OpenSPARC project provides SunOS 5.11 and Ubuntu7.10 ramdisk images for
use on the FPGA emulated system. Both systems have a 64-bit kernel, while
user-mode programs are limited to 32 bits. According to the SPARC Assembly
Language Reference Manual[2], specific 64-bit registers allow a 32-bit
program to utilize their entire length. "The global registers and the
output registers can be used to hold 64-bit integer values, but the input
registers and the local registers can only be used to hold 32-bit values in
the lower half of the register."

Ubuntu7.10's 32-bit libc-2.6.1.so employs 64-bit registers in its strcmp()
function. If memory addresses align, a CMP instruction with 64-bit register
operands compares strings; otherwise, byte-by-byte comparison occurs. In
the code snippet below, LDXA reads 64-bit data, and the CMP instruction
compares two 64-bit operands, o2 and o3.


                             LAB_0018d310         XREF[2]:     0018d328(j),

I also examined Debian 9.0, a 64-bit system on the SPARC64 platform, and
found its libpam and libc are quite similar to their counterparts in Ubuntu
7.10 SPARC32+. This suggests that, from the perspective of our CPU
backdoor, this aspect has remained largely unchanged over the years.
However, in Debian 9.0, strcmp() uses XOR instead of CMP for comparison.
This minor alteration renders the backdoor ineffective if the backdoor is
implemented solely on the CMP instruction. Perhaps CPU vendors could
persuade compiler developers not to make such changes. Alternatively, if we
could anticipate such changes, we could implement the backdoor using both
instructions. After all, there are not many instructions that can be used
to compare stuff.

In contrast to Ubuntu, SunOS 5.11's libc utilizes only 32-bit operands.
Adjustments are necessary for this backdoor to be compatible with SunOS,
yet, for simplicity, this paper focuses solely on the Ubuntu scenario.

The authentication process relies on libpam (Pluggable Authentication
Modules for Linux) to authenticate user-entered passwords, followed by a
comparison of hash strings. Our backdoor specifically targets the CMP
instruction. Ubuntu 7.10, similar to other Linux distributions, offers a
variety of hash algorithms, such as MD5 and SHA256. Below is an example
illustrating two hash strings, with the numeric value between the initial
two $ symbols signifying the algorithm employed for generating each hash.


"root:$1$7c71xB0y$mPkMSwwbMWgEXsyD6YV/C1:14168:0:99999:7:::"

"u:$6$zE3nVD4laY6MS31E$NK4TnaebdS.O9FX9Q.pg7/yH.fH5bi8bHCFJdFbEaPtmW/59KKB7
JDk53W21ZoLnKhrkmB4u5cXE.9ynmeIEw0:18811:0:99999:7:::"


*nix systems introduce another challenge with the use of salt, as seen in
the MD5 example. The hash begins with $1$, followed by the salt string
ending with another $. The length of the salt string varies depending on
the algorithm. The remaining portion represents the hash itself. The issue
arises when the hash is salted, resulting in potentially millions of
different hash strings for the same password. Consequently, after hashing,
the CPU cannot discern the original password. Hence, during password
authentication, the username serves as the sole method to convey a clear
message to the CPU, especially crucial for network login scenarios.

Our new approach leverages unique usernames to toggle the backdoor on or
off. When enabled, the CPU bypasses any login authentication it encounters.
For instance, "00000000" serves as the secret username to activate the CPU
backdoor. As it is 8 bytes long, it fits into a 64-bit register. Initially,
libpam checks this username against entries in the /etc/password file, with
the first user typically being "root". Therefore, when comparing "00000000"
with "root", the CPU interprets it as a "CMP reg-rs1 reg-rs2" instruction,
where the rs1 register holds 0x726f6f7400000000 and the rs2 register
contains 0x3030303030303030.

Upon encountering these two values, the CPU proceeds to inspect subsequent
hash comparisons. Specifically, it seeks a pattern where both rs1 and rs2
registers contain "$1$". This is because *nix systems compare the entire
string, including the hash type and salt string.

Here's how *nix password authentication operates. The crypt() function
generates the hash value:


char * crypt(const char *phrase, const char *setting);


libpam passes both the user input password and the hash string stored in
the /etc/shadow file to crypt():


pp = crypt("password_input", "$1$salt$hashxxxxx");


The returned value is a pointer to the newly generated hash string, which
is later compared to the stored hash string using strcmp():


ret = strcmp(pp, stored_hash);


So, the strcmp() function is crucial. When the backdoor activates, for
every CMP instruction comparing hash fragments, the CPU should yield a
result indicating equality between the operands. Typically, a 0x00 within
an operand signifies the end of the string being compared. However, this
also hinges on the length of the entire string, which varies due to the
hash function and salt size.

Here's a brief overview of the OpenSPARC T1 core. It's a single-issue,
in-order processor coded in Verilog. Unlike how a software emulator handles
an instruction, a CPU features multiple pipeline stages: Fetch, Switch,
Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback for the SPARC core. Each stage
contributes to the instruction processing, with the instruction progress
through each stage. The SPARC core comprises units such as IFU (Instruction
Fetch Unit), EXU (Execution Unit), LSU (Load-Store Unit), TLU (Trap Logic
Unit), etc. Essentially, the core can be divided into two main sections:
the IFU, which retrieves instructions from cache or memory, and the EXU,
which executes them. The IFU includes Fetch, Switch, and Decode stages,
while the EXU comprises the Execute stage, divided into four subunits: ALU
(Arithmetic and Logic Unit), SHFT (Shifter), IMUL (Integer Multiplier), and
IDI (Integer Divider).

The SPARC core supports four strands (virtual processors), each equipped
with a complete register file. During the Fetch cycle, instructions are
fetched from the instruction cache (icache) and loaded into the instruction
registers. The Switch stage determines which strand to execute next.
Subsequently, at the Decode stage, the next instruction for the selected
strand is decoded, and register file access occurs. In the Execute stage,
all arithmetic and logical operations are performed, alongside memory
address calculation by the LSU. Memory access occurs at the Memory stage
through the data cache. Finally, instructions are committed in the
Writeback stage.

Our backdoor operates within the ALU to alter the behavior of the CMP
(SUBcc) instruction. During the Execute cycle, the ALU processes the two
operands of a CMP instruction, which are already fetched and sent to it.
Below is the ALU module.

The module contains two main parts: sparc_exu_alulogic for logical
operations and sparc_exu_aluaddsub for addition and subtraction. Since the
backdoor affects the CMP instruction, our attention is directed towards the
sparc_exu_aluaddsub module.

The sparc_exu_aluaddsub module receives almost all necessary signals for
the backdoor. For instance, byp_alu_rs1_data_e and byp_alu_rs2_data_e
represent the operand values. Signals ecl_alu_cin_e and ifu_exu_invert_d
jointly determine whether the operation is addition or subtraction. 

However, obtaining the destination register index rd is crucial as it
indicates which register to update in the Writeback stage. Regarding the
CMP instruction, it's a pseudo-instruction. When the compiler generates
binary code for "cmp reg rs1, reg_or_imm," it's essentially "subcc reg rs1,
reg_or_imm, %g0." Here, the target register is the read-only g0 register,
indicating that the instruction disregards the calculation result but sets
the flag. This detail is essential for distinguishing between CMP and
regular SUBcc instructions.

The rd index, encoded in the instruction, is decoded post Decode stage. The
sparc_exu_ecl module manages control logic and stores pipeline registers.
Thus, we route the register index, ecl_alu_rd_e, to the ALU module.

The following is the sparc_exu_aluaddsub module.

In the CPU, both addition and subtraction are computed as additions. The
distinction lies in how subtraction is performed: it involves taking the
complement of the subtrahend, adding one, and then performing addition. The
ifu_exu_invert_d signal indicates a subtraction operation, necessitating
the inversion of all bits in the second operand. This signal is generated
in the Decode stage and requires a pipeline register to propagate to the
Execute stage. Meanwhile, ecl_alu_cin_e represents the carry bit, which
operates inversely during subtraction: it's set to 1 in the SUB instruction
and 0 in the SUBC (SUB with Carry) instruction. Additionally, the
sparc_exu_aluspr module handles comparison operations with the carry bit,
yielding zero if the two operands are equal.

When the backdoor is active, if the ALU performs hash string comparisons,
the outputs of the sparc_exu_aluspr and sparc_exu_aluadder64 modules should
both yield zero.

The following is the sparc_exu_aluaddsub module with our backdoor.

When the ALU detects the magic keywords within operands, it signals
backdoor_on_keyword and backdoor_off_keyword. For testing purposes, the
magic keyword "00000000" activates the backdoor, while "00000001"
deactivates it. These signals operate as combination logic. To retain their
values for subsequent instructions, a D Flip Flop (DFF) with an enable bit
is employed. The following represents the logic for backdoor_en and
backdoor_nxt, along with the corresponding truth table. 


   assign backdoor_en = (backdoor_on_keyword | backdoor_off_keyword);
   assign backdoor_nxt = (backdoor_on_keyword & (~backdoor_off_keyword));

As previously mentioned, the ALU solely performs computations without
distinguishing between a CMP or SUBcc instruction. Moreover, it's not only
arithmetic instructions that require ALU for computation. It's imperative
to ensure that the compromised instruction is indeed a CMP to minimize
conflicts within the system.


   assign issubrd0 = (5'h0 == ecl_alu_rd_e[4:0]) & sub_e & ecl_alu_cin_e;


As depicted below, a hash string will be segmented into 64-bit integers and
compared multiple times with its counterparts.


$1$7c71x        0x2431243763373178
B0y$mPkM        0x423079246d506b4d

C1              0x4331


When the ALU detects the leading portion of hash strings, it triggers the
signal hash_begin. Conversely, the signal hash_00 indicates the end segment
of the hash string. The middle section of the hash string doesn't exhibit
any notable pattern, except for each byte being a printable ASCII
character. For testing purposes, we predefine the length of the hash
string. The presence of 00 byte may vary in position based on the hash
algorithm and salt length. Implementing more complex pattern rules can
further improve screening accuracy.


   assign hash_begin = ((24'h243124 == byp_alu_rs1_data_e[63:40]) 
                     && (24'h243124 == byp_alu_rs2_data_e[63:40])) 
                     & issubrd0;
   assign hash_00 = (8'h0 == byp_alu_rs1_data_e[47:40]) 
                  & (8'h0 == byp_alu_rs2_data_e[47:40]);
   assign hash_end = hash_r & hash_00 & issubrd0;


A 1-bit DFF is used to propagate through followed cycles to indicatet
whether the hash has begun.


   assign hash_en = (hash_begin | hash_end) & backdoor_r;
   assign hash_nxt = hash_begin & (~hash_end);

   dffe_s #(1) hash_dffe(.din(hash_nxt), .en(hash_en),
                        .clk(clk), .q(hash_r), .se(se),
                        .si(), .so());

   assign trigger_backdoor = (hash_r | hash_begin) & issubrd0;


The hash_dffe operates only when the backdoor is active, as its enable bit,
hash_en, is determined by the backdoor_r signal. If both hash_r and
issubrd0 are signaled, it triggers the backdoor for the current CMP
instruction, resulting in the subsequent two output signals being zeroed.


   assign spr_out[63:0] = spr_out_tmp[63:0] & {64{~trigger_backdoor}}; 
   assign adder_out[63:0] = adder_out_tmp[63:0] & {64{~trigger_backdoor}};


To support additional hash algorithms, the backdoor necessitates more
combinational logic to differentiate between various hash strings, such as
those starting with $1$ and $6$. However, increasing the complexity of the
combinational logic may increase propagation time, potentially violating
the processor's timing constraints. Thus, the backdoor's logic must remain
relatively simple. For testing purposes, this logic for hash string type
and length is hardcoded, and these rules alone may not fully prevent
conflicts with other regular CMP instructions. Therefore, once an attacker
gains access, it's crucial to promptly close the backdoor.

The following output logs showcase the operation of the CPU backdoor on the
OpenSPARC T1 system running Ubuntu 7.10. This setup operates on the Xilinx
ML505-V5LX110T FPGA board, with the console accessible through the serial
port.

Here's how the backdoor operates: Initially, enter "00000000" as the
username, activating the backdoor as explained earlier. However, this login
attempt should fail since the user account "00000000" doesn't exist in the
system. Then, the attacker could use any valid user account to log in, such
as "root." No password is required, and the "#" prompt appears. To
deactivate the backdoor, simply log in again and enter "00000001" as the
username.

The backdoor can also be utilized for SSH remote login, provided the SSH
service is configured with password authentication.

AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) is an extension of the x86 instruction set
designed for Intel and AMD microprocessors. It employs sixteen YMM
registers to execute a single instruction on multiple pieces of data, known
as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.

Functions like strcmp() can have multiple versions depending on which
instruction extensions are supported by the system's CPU. Utilizing SIMD
instruction sets can accelerate the strcmp() function. For instance, glibc
provides various versions, including AVX2, as shown in the following code:


/* Support sysdeps/x86_64/multiarch/strcmp.c.  */
IFUNC_IMPL (i, name, strcmp,
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp,
                            HAS_ARCH_FEATURE (AVX2_Usable),
                            __strcmp_avx2)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, HAS_CPU_FEATURE (SSE4_2),
                            __strcmp_sse42)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, HAS_CPU_FEATURE (SSSE3),
                            __strcmp_ssse3)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, 1, __strcmp_sse2_unaligned)
            IFUNC_IMPL_ADD (array, i, strcmp, 1, __strcmp_sse2))


This mechanism is known as IFUNC (Indirect Function)[17]. It's a feature of
the GNU toolchain that enables developers to create multiple
implementations of a function and select among them at runtime using a
resolver function. The dynamic loader calls the resolver function during
early startup to determine which implementations will be used by the
application. Once a choice is made, it remains fixed for the process's
lifetime.

The concept of string comparison (byte or dword) using AVX2 involves
comparing (VPCMPEQ) two ymm vectors. Since ymm registers are 256-bit, a
single VPCMPEQ instruction can compare two 32-byte (VEC_SIZE) strings.
Assuming avoiding page boundary issues, the following two instructions
execute the comparison for 32 bytes:


vmovdqu (%rdi),%ymm1
vpcmpeqb (%rsi),%ymm1,%ymm0


The vmovdqu instruction retrieves 32 bytes from the memory address in the
rdi register and loads them into the ymm1 register. Subsequently, vpcmpeqb,
using rsi as the memory address, reads 32 bytes, compares them with the
data in ymm1, and stores the result in ymm0. If two data elements are
equal, the corresponding element in the destination operand is set to all
1s; otherwise, it is set to all 0s.

So the instruction vpcmpeqb does the comparision. It is a more suitable
instruction to implant a backdoor. Because it compare more data, it is
easier to identify the hash string, less likely trigger the backdoor by
mistake.


----[ 4.2 Crazy Ideas

In a computer system, trust begins with the firmware. The CPU executes an
initial code stored in ROM/OTPROM (One-Time Programmable ROM), which
verifies subsequent firmware. This verification employs a digital signature
mechanism, typically using an asynchronous encryption algorithm such as
RSA. The next stage of firmware is signed with a private key, requiring the
ROM code to use the corresponding public key for verification. This
combination of ROM code and public key is widely recognized as the root of
trust.

The ROM, particularly OTPROM, has limited capacity. As a result, in
practice, the hash of the public key is stored in OTPROM, while the public
key itself is stored in writable storage like EEPROM or FLASH. Therefore,
the ROM code's first task is to retrieve the public key and verify its hash
against the one stored in ROM. Ultimately, the root of trust relies on
comparing these two hash strings.

Let's examine how digital signatures work, using RSA (RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5) as
an example.

Assume "bin" is the entity to be verified and "bin_sig" is its digital
signature. Here's the process for verifying a signature using the public
key:


1. Compute the SHA256 hash of "bin."

   hash = sha256(bin);

2. Encode the hash value according to the widely used EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5
   protocol, which doesn't involve using a salt.

   hash_encode = EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5(hash);

3. Decrypt "bin_sig" with the public key using the RSA algorithm. This
   yields an encoded hash. Encoding ensures the hash becomes a large number
   suitable for the RSA algorithm.

   hash_encode_from_sig = rsa_decrypt(bin_sig, public_key);

4. Compare the decoded hash from the signature with the encoded hash
   derived from the original data.

   cmp(hash_encode_from_sig, hash_encode);


Once more, the final comparison of hashes determines the result. 

In practice, it's not particularly useful for the CPU to remember only one
or several hash strings. Consider if the hash function had a algorithmic
backdoor, leaving secret patterns in the hash when the input's initial
bytes contain a special "header." This pattern could be identified by the
CPU during string comparison and allowed to pass. I am not sure if this is
possible, but it's definitely a interesting idea to think about.


----[ 4.3 Notes on Xilinx FPGA Tool

"OpenSPARC T1 Processor Design and Verification User's Guide" and
"OpenSPARC Internals" are both excellent resources on OpenSPARC T1. These
books offer detailed tutorials on compiling the processor and generating
the bitstream file.

Xilinx EDK (Embedded Development Kit) and ISE (Integrated Synthesis
Environment) are necessary for placing and routing a design on a Xilinx
FPGA and downloading it to the FPGA. Testing was conducted on Ubuntu 20.04,
contrary to the specified requirements in the book. Specifically, ISE
version 9.1i and EDK version 10.1 sp3 are required.

Here are some notes detailing errors I encountered and their respective
solutions.


1) microblaze_7_10_d IP missing.

Install EDK10.1 sp3.


2) ERROR:MDT - IPNAME:hard_ethernet_mac_wrapper INSTANCE:hard_ethernet_mac
...  License missing. 

Find the corresponding license and put it in the
Xilinx/10.1/ISE/coregen/core_licenses/ directory.


3) Error occurred during initialization of VM
java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/Object ERROR:coreutil - Aborting
COREGEN execution!

The java j2se (Xilinx/10.1/ISE/java/) that comes with ISE9.1i is too old.
Install Java SE Development Kit 5.0u22.
https://download.oracle.com/otn/java/jdk/1.5.0_22/jdk-1_5_0_22-linux
-amd64.bin

Replace Xilinx/10.1/ISE/java/lin64/jre directory with the new one
installed.


4) ERROR:Bitgen - Unknown PLL_ADV site in pminfo.

This error arises from a bug in
Xilinx/10.1/ISE/virtex5/lib/lin64/libBsRain_Bitgen.so. Within the
BsRain_BfdTile::plladvpminfo function, there exists an unnecessary string
destructor, which nulls the first four bytes of the name string.

Port::StringBase<char>::~StringBase((StringBase<char>*)&local_48);
_ZN4Port10StringBaseIcED1Ev@plt.

Removing this destructor resolves the issue.


--[ 5. Conclusion

This article outlines a practical CPU backdoor designed to circumvent
mainstream operating system password authentication. The prototype is
implemented on the OpenSPARC T1 processor and tested using the Xilinx
ML505-V5LX110T FPGA board.

We argue that creating a CPU backdoor solely through hardware poses
challenges. Instead, a symbiotic relationship between hardware and
upper-layer software is proposed. While software keeps changing, certain
critical libraries stay the same for ages. 

Hope this marks just the start of exploring CPU backdoors.
